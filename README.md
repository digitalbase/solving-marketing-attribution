# solving-marketing-attribution

This repository is my attempt at solving marketing attribution using existing tools:

* Segment.com
* Mixpanel (or Amplitude) for reporting
* Serverless functions

I will link to blog posts to explain the why/how this all works

## Solution Components

### Identifying Visitor Origin

In order to identify visitors we set up a webhook that is configured as segment.com destination. More inforation
